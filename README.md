# YouthMappers Validation Hub Activitives
The YouthMappers Validation Hub is a group of experienced student mappers whose purpose is to ensure a high standard of data quality in the collaborative mapping platform OpenStreetMap (OSM). Formed in May 2019, the Validation Hub was organized and implemented by faculty and students at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Our primary focus is to validate the work of OSM contributors and guarantee that all YouthMappers projects have the highest quality data. We are also interested in the behavior of new and current mappers and understand that the only way to enhance contributions is to improve the technique, habits, and conduct of mappers

This repo provides data mining codes for processing the the Validation Hub activities and related projects.
